			<p>
			<p>My name is Milan Jovanovic, my close mates call me Milzzy. My student number is s3905808 and if need be to contact me, you can find me through s3905808@student.rmit.edu.au. A little bit about myself is that I was born in Dandenong in Victoria Australia on the 29th of June 2002. Raised mostly where I was born but on most summer breaks I was in Serbia where my mum and dad were born. Which leads me to my nationality, I'm Serbian and I'm pretty fluent in it and anything that closely resembles the language when it comes to speaking or listening but if it goes anywhere near writing or reading in the Cyrillic alphabet, I'm hopeless. I can say confidently that I have only lived in Dandenong but going overseas to Serbia is like my 2nd life I like to call that since it is a totally different landscape to Australia in terms of its culture and people. Speaking of overseas travel, I’ve been to 4/7 continents, this includes Australia, Europe, Asia and North America. I wouldn’t be able to count on both of my hands how many times I’ve been overseas since I don’t remember all of it but I’m definitely fortunate and grateful for the number of times I’ve been thanks to my parents and keeping strong ties with our family overseas. Moving onto Education, I’ve done the basics, Kindergarten all the way through to Year 12 and graduated with the class of 2020 and what a depressing year that was. No motivation to do any of my work or try to even get a good ATAR because of COVID and the helpless feeling of not knowing what’s next but as life kicks you in the gut and your brain sparks up again saying “yo dude, you got next year as well, like University and getting a job hopefully?” you go back to doing your own stuff.</p>

			<p>Anyway, enough of talking about education and the boring stuff, let’s talk about hobbies? Yeah hobbies, well majority of the time when I’m relaxing, I play Video Games and listening to music. In terms of Video Games, I’ve played the lot in terms of genre and right now I’m really enjoying Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and really keen on the Diablo 2 Remaster. In terms of Music, I pretty much listen to anything going from pop, rap, metal, rock etc. I don’t hate a genre since I can appreciate each aspect and element of it but majority of the time, I listen to Psychedelic rock. Besides my down time where I just do that stuff, I play Futsal and Soccer as a goalkeeper from Monday to Thursday and Sunday. Soccer has been a big part of my life even though I stopped playing when I entered High School for some weird reason but it’s a sport that I couldn’t think about living without, my favourite team would be Partizan FC which is a Serbian team in the Serbian League but if we’re talking about premier league then it’s Manchester United.</p>
			
			<h2>Interest in I.T</h2>
			<p>My interest started when I got my first desktop computer which was in 2013 and also talking to my friend Callum who was already in the field gave me an insight into the I.T world and business when I was younger. The only I.T Experience that I’ve gained is through my Year 9-12 Studies at St John’s Regional College doing Software Development and occasionally watching YouTube videos about the topic. Going onto my actual specific interests in Information Techonology is do with Programming and User Interface Design. Since during my studies for Software Development, for every single project that we started, you needed to do a model which consisted of Analysis, Design, Development and Evaluation and I always enjoyed my time during the Design and Development stage which was mainly programming and thinking about User Interfaces. It always piqued my interest as it's a challenging and methodical challenge to make the software to run but also make it look aesthetically pleasing to the user. </p>
			
			<p>I chose RMIT due to my school having a partnership program for easier entry on ATAR but also because of past friends who graduated that already went stating that RMIT has a good I.T course and facilities for the subject. And by going to RMIT, I expect to gain experience and knowledge on the fundamentals of Information Technology for further studies in specific fields of I.T such as programming, databases and User Centred Design. But also gain an overview of what I.T helps to achieve in our technological modern society and how the application of I.T is used in specific jobs.  </p>
			
			<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			
			<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51871852?type=standout#searchRequestToken=5ef6d8da-fd80-4647-94c1-e94ce8965934"><p style="text-align:center">My Ideal job in I.T would be to become a Software Developer</a>
			
			<p>The skills that a Software Developer needs is a proficiency in multiple programming languages such as MS SQL, Java, ReactJS, JavaScript and Python. Experience in using modern source code control and GitHub. Experience with azure services and architectures and working in an agile environment. Additionally, having good problem-solving skills and being able to explain them to others. Why this position appeals to me are that it takes critical thinking, communication and proficiency to be able to work efficiently for such a job. As in specific situations, certain software that needs to be developed may only need one software developer whereas larger scale operation may need a whole team to do it. Creating such a wide variety of social interaction to finish a common cause or in contrast silently working on your own thing piqued my interest of software development as it has variety in the work that the developer may be able to do. </p>
			
			<p>The skills that I have and can bring currently are nowhere close to what I want to do in the future as I only have a basic understanding of Python and HTML Coding through my Bachelor of Information Technology that I am currently doing but also through my VCE studies. However, I can bring a teamworking environment as I can bounce off of others very efficiently as I have been a part of soccer clubs, eSports teams and I am currently working as an Estimator Apprentice in a Construction company where talking to co-workers is a must to be able to get certain jobs done. Carrying on with my current job, problem solving skills and being analytical is a must where if you are not on-point specific can either create a short number of resources for the job or an oversupply of material that will be wasted. </p>
			
			<p>The way I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience needed to be able to be hired for this position is by obviously completing my Bachelor of Information Technology from RMIT. This will take 3 years if there are no major interruptions in my personal life and if I continue to do full-time study. Initially by applying for internship jobs in I.T specific fields in the industry to gain experience in the trade as companies seek out individuals who have already worked in the field rather than a fresh graduate who has finished their bachelor. After a year or two of being a intern, hopefully, I’ll be able to move onto a role of programmer or software developer for a small IT company and gain proficiency and experience in working on front-end software development jobs for 3-5 years before continuing on and applying for Full Stack as a Software Developer. </P>

			<p> Your Response indicates that your preferred learning style is <b>Auditory</b></p>
			<p>
			
			<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
			<p>The results from the tests that I’ve taken determine my personality type to be extroverted in social settings with an assertive action taken when dealt with a situation, attacking it with a logical solution for the cause rather than an emotionally driven state of mind. It also concludes that when dealt with a learning aspect or being told something what to do, I will most likely remember the information through listening rather through actions or visuals. </p>
			
			<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>

			<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
			<p>When forming a team I should take into account by trying to find other people who are willing to cut me off or speak up when I am getting too invested within a conversation about the project as it will improve the quality and effectiveness of the group for when a group project is to be done.</p>
			
			<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			<p>This project will be a soccer goalkeeping kit with motion tracking features within the clothing to track positioning techniques for the user to improve on their Soccer goalkeeping ability. The software which the user will be able to track their techniques is through an application which will be connected through the motion tracking system. </p>
			
			<p>The motivation behind this project is due to this technology not being already implemented for goalkeeping training especially for clubs at the amatuer level who cannot hire a goalkeeping coach full time and goalkeepers who are confused on how to improve their techniques. It may also help advanced goalkeepers who think that the techniques that they are using are fine but in reality are making a slight mistake which may cost them a win in future official games. </p>
			
			<p>Within the application, there will also be an additional page where goalkeeping vidoes/tutorials will be presented. The algorithm within the application will take the information that is already saved within the app to show the most relevant content at the top of the page. This will present itself to the user so they can easily access and fine information about techniques that they need to improve on or learn how to use in the next training session.</p>
			
			<p>The hardware required for this project to be accomplished is a motion tracker to fit within the goalkeeping kit which will not hinder the performance of the user and is able to connect to the application wirelessly to input information of the user’s techniques. Additionally, the software required is a development of an application which can be connected to the motion tracker to display the information to the user. </p>
			
			<p>The skills required for this project to be developed is the use of advanced programming to be able to create an algorithm which can track the motion capturing goalkeeping kit’s techniques when the user is wearing it and to determine wether or not they are using the right positioning technique. In determining wether or not this project can come to fruition is through the goalkeeping motion tracker to determine if the user is using the right positioning techniques.</p>
			
			<p>The outcome of this project is for the user developing, acquiring and improving their goalkeeper positioning techniques whenever and wherethere they want to by playing with this goalkeeper kit on. So that in future games of Soccer, they are able to use the right techniques to block the ball from going into their goal to attain a win for their club. Overall, it is for the user to improve in their goalkeeping ability by using such techonology. </p>
